# World-Model-LunarLanderContinuous-v2-with-PPO

This repository contains all files we produced/collected for our reimplementation of the "World Models" agent to solve the CarRacing_v0 gym environment as proposed by Schmidhuber and Ha in 2018 (https://github.com/worldmodels/worldmodels.github.io.git).

We split the work up into two final projects:
* implementation, training and project documentation for the Vision and Memory Modules - together constituting the so-called "World Model" (for the "Implementing Neural Networks with TensorFlow" course)
* implementation, training and project documentation of the Controller Module (for the block-course "Deep Reinforcement Learning")

## Repo structure
The files for Vision, Memory and Controller models and training (results) can be found in the respective subdirectories of the "world_model" directory.
The "notebooks" directory contains a supplementary/additional notebook which we set up for testing mdn output layers and developing an own version of the Memory module.
The folder "documentation" contains the (previously mentioned) project documentations in ".pdf" format.

The really folder contains a copy of the ["ReAllY"](https://github.com/geronimocharlie/ReAllY.git) framework by [Charlie](https://github.com/geronimocharlie).
